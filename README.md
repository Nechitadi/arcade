This is my Frogger clone for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree


Installation: Download the repository.

Gameplay:
1. Press enter to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to move.
3. The objective is to reach the top of the water and collect gems to score.
4. Each time you reach the top of the water, the difficulty increases.
5. Avoid the bugs, they kill you. You have five lives.
