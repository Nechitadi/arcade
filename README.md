frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
This is my Frogger clone for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree


Installation: Download the repository.
(Click download ZIP on the left, then extract the zip file to your computer, or clone the repository using git.)
Double-click index.html

Or, go to http://lacyjpr.github.io/arcade/


Gameplay:
Press enter to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to move.
The objective is to reach the top of the water and collect gems to score.
Each time you reach the top of the water, the difficulty increases.
Avoid the bugs, they kill you. You have five lives.
